To deploy your frontend on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

Make sure you have a GitHub repository for your project.
Create a new branch in your repository, for example, gh-pages.
Push your frontend code to the gh-pages branch.
Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
Click on "Pages" in the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar.
Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch".
Choose the gh-pages branch as your publishing source.
Optionally, select a folder for your publishing source, for example, / (root) or /docs.
Click "Save".
That's it! Your frontend should now be deployed on GitHub Pages. You can access your site at https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name.
